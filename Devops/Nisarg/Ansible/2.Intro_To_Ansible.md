# Ansible
- Open-source IT automation tool that simplifies the process of 
    - Install Software / Orchestrating workflows
    - Configure Server / Configuring systems
    - Deploy App / Deploying software

> If we do not have Ansible?
- Then we will use bash script and, use ssh method to connect to server and run the script to install required software.

> If we have Ansible
- Here instead of running command like bash script, we can have description of it, and it is easy to understand.

> Advantages of Ansible
- Simple to Learn
- Integration with DevOps Practices
- Agentless Architecture
- Powerful Automation Capabilities
- Use of Python and YAML

# Why it is Agent-less ?
- Ansible is installed on Developer's machine and not on server.
- When we execute it, it uses ssh to connect to remote machine/server and execute all the required commands.
- To put it simply 
```Ansible is called agentless because it doesn't require any software to be installed on the machines it manages. Instead, it connects to these machines over SSH or WinRM and executes tasks directly, eliminating the need for managing agents on each target system.```

> How Ansible works?
- Need to write ```YAML`` file and it is called Ansible playbook.

> Install Ansible
- For windows:
    - Install wsl
    - ```sudo apt-get update```
    - ```sudo apt-get upgrade```
    - ```sudo apt-get python3-pip git libffi-dev libssl-dev python-is-python3 -y```
    - ```sudo apt-get install ansible```

# Project Structure of Ansible

- Ansible_Project_Folder
    - *Inventory* Folder
        - *vm-setup-playbook* Folder
            - *hosts*: file containing IP / Domain name  of all the host.
    - *roles* Folder // it contains many roles, each role has a task to be performed
        - *role1* Folder
            - *tasks* Folder
                - *main.yaml* File
        - *playbook.yaml*  Core File of our project.
            - Include remote host to connect from hosts file
            - Define remote user
            - Include Roles to run

-Cmd to execute playbook:

> ansible-playbook --inventory inventory/folder-name/hosts  main-playbook-file.yaml

# Setting Private and Public key for Ansible
- ```ssh-keygen``` creates this pair of keys.
- Private for us, Public for Server.
- ```ssh-copy-id -i path/to/public/key  userName@IP_OF_SERVER``` Use this command to copy public key to the remote server.
- Now associates private key with playbook.
    - In host file alongside IP address set variable ```ansible_ssh_private_key_file``` with value of ```path/to/private_key```
