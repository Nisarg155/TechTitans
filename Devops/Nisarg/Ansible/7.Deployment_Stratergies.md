# Deployment Strategies
- Single Server
    - Only Single Host in **hosts** file.
    - Simple command for execution
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook --inventory path/to/hosts playbook-name.yaml
    ```
- Multi Server
    - Multiple Hosts in **hosts** file.
    ```yaml
    [blue]
    ip1
    ip2

    [green]
    ip3
    ip4
    ```
    - same command as above.

### Deploy on All Servers
### Deploy on Selected Server
### Blue Green Deployment Strategy
- When deploying app on multiple servers it is difficult to remember IP of all, so we divide it into 2 main groups: _BLUE_ and _GREEN_ servers.
- Green(Active):
    - Actively working servers in production environment, which actually servers users.
- Blue(Passive):
    - It is also production server, but not actively serving users.
    - New features are deployed here first.
- So once our deployment of new features is successful on **blue** servers, then we will cutoff traffic from **green** server and redirect it to blue one.
- So no downtime in production.
- Need to add ```--limit``` flag in ansible command to limit deployment to a particular group.
```bash
ansible-playbook --inventory path/to/hosts playbook.yaml --limit group_name_in_hosts_file
```
