# Environment variables
- We can declare it using, environment property.
```yaml
# below is variable at playbook level
environment:
  EXAMPLE_VAR_NAME: "value"

tasks:
  - name: Environment var at playbook level
    ansible.builtin.command: "echo $EXAMPLE_VAR_NAME"

  - name: ENV var at task level
    environment:
      TASK_LEVEL_VARIABLE: "Value"
    ansible.builtin.command: "echo $TASK_LEVEL_VARIABLE"
    
```

# Conditional Variables
- when clause: Used to execute a task or role only when a specific condition is true.

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Install package
    apt:
      name: package
      state: present
    when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'
```

- if statement: Used in templates to conditionally render content.
```yaml
jinja
{% if ansible_os_family == 'Debian' %}
  <p>This is a Debian-based system.</p>
{% endif %}
```

- condition module: Used to evaluate complex conditions and store the result in a variable.
```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Evaluate condition
    condition:
      - ansible_os_family == 'Debian'
      - ansible_architecture == 'x86_64'
    register: is_debian_x64

  - name: Install package
    apt:
      name: package
      state: present
    when: is_debian_x64
```
- block module: Used to group tasks and apply conditions to the entire block.

```yaml
tasks:
  - block:
    - name: Install packages
      apt:
        name: package
        state: present
    - name: Restart service
      service:
        name: service
        state: restarted
    when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'
```

- Ansible also provides several built-in variables and facts that can be used in conditional statements, such as:

  - ansible_os_family: The operating system family (e.g., Debian, RedHat, Windows).
  - ansible_architecture: The system architecture (e.g., x86_64, armv7l).
  - ansible_distribution: The distribution name (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS).
  - ansible_distribution_major_version: The major version of the distribution (e.g., 20, 18).

These variables and facts can be used to create flexible and dynamic playbooks that adapt to different environments and systems.
