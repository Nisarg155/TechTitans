# Variables in Ansible
- Types
    - String
    ```yaml
    main_playbook_variable: "Nisarg"
    ```
    - Boolean
    ```yaml
    is_Nisarg_Good: true
    ```
    - List
    ```yaml
    favorite_anime:
        - Naruto
        - One Piece
        - Horimiya
        - Yourname
        - Black Clover
        - Pokemon

        # Accessing a value
    debug:
        var: favorite_anime[0]
    ```
    - Map/Dictionary
    ```yaml
    price_of_manga:
        naruto: "RS100"
        one-piece: "RS100"

        # Accessing a value
    debug:
        var: price_of_manga.naruto
    ```

- You can declare a variable in ansible using ```vars``` property as:
```yaml
---
- name: some_name
  vars:
    variable_name: variable_value
```

- To Print Something while executing playbook, write ```debug```

```yaml
debug:
    msg: "Message to be printed"
    var: var_name #variable name to be printed. # Optional
    when: boolean condition when to print # Optional
```

---

## Registering the value of old var to new var
```yaml
- name: some_name
  command: echo "{{price_of_manga['one-piece']}}"
  register: one_piece_manga_price
- name: debug new var value
  debug: 
    var: one_piece_manga_price.stdout
```

---

## Nested Vars
```yaml
watch_list:
    - name: shounen
      anime:
        - naruto
        - one-Piece
    - name: slice-of-life
      anime:
        - Your name
        - Hello World

# Accessing above vars.
    - name: Get price of naruto by accessing it's value from above var and using it in price_of_manga var.
      debug:
        var: price_of_manga[watch_list[0].anime[0]]
```

---

## Jinja 2 Filters on variables
```yaml
- name: Using Jinja 2 Filters
  debug:
    var: price_of_manga.keys() | list | map('upper') | list
```

---


## Importing vars file
- We can also declare only variables in a file and import that file in to our playbook
```yaml
vars_files:
  - path-to-vars-file.yaml
```
- After this we can use variable present in file as we use to do when declared in playbook.

---

## Passing Variable at runtime
- Execute command as
```bash
ansible-playbook --inventory path/to/hosts path/to/ansible-playbook.yaml --extra-vars '{"var1":"This is Extra Var"}'
```

- In Playbook
```yaml
- name: Var at runtime
  debug:
    var: var1
```

---

## Passing Vars file at runtime
- Execute command as
```bash
ansible-playbook --inventory path/to/hosts path/to/ansible-playbook.yaml --extra-vars "@path/to/vars-file.yaml"
```
- In Playbook we can access variable normally
- Can also pass JSON as we passed yaml

---
# Precedence of Variables
- The Variables entered at runtime i.e. passed as command line argument is given preference.
