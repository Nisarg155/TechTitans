# Ansible Vault
- Encrypts important data that is in plain text format when in playbook.
- Ansible Vault is a built-in tool that lets you encrypt sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc.) within your Ansible playbooks and variable files. This ensures that this data remains hidden from unauthorized users who might have access to the playbook files.
- When you run the playbook using ansible-playbook main.yml, Ansible will prompt you for the vault password to decrypt the variables on the fly.
