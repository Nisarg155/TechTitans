# Ansible Handlers
- What are They ?
    - Ansible handlers are special tasks that execute only when notified by another task using the notify directive. 
- When to use them?
    - They are designed to perform actions like restarting services when a configuration change occurs, ensuring idempotency by running only when there's a change in state. 
- Handlers are defined under the handlers: section in a playbook and are executed at the end of the play, after all tasks have completed.
