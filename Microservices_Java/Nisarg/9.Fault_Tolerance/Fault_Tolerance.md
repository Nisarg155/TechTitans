# Fault Tolerance
- Ability to continue operating without interruption.
- For Example: 
    Among Multiple Microservices of our app, if one fails, then all the calls going to that microservice will fail, and whole app/network of services will fail.
- Resilience: Ability to recover quickly from difficulties.

## Need of Fault Tolerance
- Fault Isolation
- Network Latency
- Deployment Issues
- Increased Complexity
- Elasticity
- Tolerating External Failure

## Techniques for Resilience
- Retries
- Rate Limiting
