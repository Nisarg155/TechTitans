# Leaders in an array

## Problem Statement

Given an array `A` of positive integers, the task is to find the leaders in the array. An element of the array is considered a leader if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side. The rightmost element is always a leader.

### Example

For example, consider the array `arr = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]`:

- The leaders are `[17, 5, 2]`.

### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr` and its size `n`, write a function to find the leaders in the array.

### Code Solution

Here is an example of how to implement the solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;

class Solution {
    // Function to find the leaders in the array.
    static ArrayList<Integer> leaders(int arr[], int n) {
        ArrayList<Integer> answer = new ArrayList<>();
        int max = arr[n - 1];
        // The rightmost element is always a leader
        answer.add(max);

        // Traverse the array from right to left
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            // If the current element is greater than or equal to max, it is a leader
            if (arr[i] >= max) {
                max = arr[i];
                answer.add(max);
            }
        }

        // Reverse the answer list to maintain the order from left to right
        Collections.reverse(answer);

        return answer;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialize an ArrayList**: Create an `ArrayList<Integer>` named `answer` to store the leaders.
2. **Rightmost Element**: The rightmost element is always a leader, so add it to the `answer` list and set it as the initial `max`.
3. **Traverse from Right to Left**: Loop through the array from the second last element to the first element:
   - If the current element is greater than or equal to `max`, it is a leader. Update `max` and add the current element to the `answer` list.
4. **Reverse the List**: Reverse the `answer` list to maintain the correct order of leaders from left to right.
5. **Return the List**: Return the `answer` list containing all the leaders.
